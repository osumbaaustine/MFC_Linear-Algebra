    "    Its May 30th 1905. The world is currrently on lockdown becuase of Corona Virus; a deadly virus that has to put a huge percentage of socio-economic activies in most countries of the world on a hold. Dumebi Chemicals, an agro-chemical comapany is currently diversifying its product line, trying to a come up with the ideal disinfectant to protect offices, schools and other enclosed spaces. With the world looking for a way to restart socio-economic activities in full despite the continued increase of infection rate of the virus, Dumebi chemicals realises that providing a way to make enclosed spaces infection free would most definitely be a commercial success. Wensaslaus, an ALU student currently studying Computer Science works as an intern for Dumebi Chemicals. Wensaslaus is tasked daily with the job of balancing a number of complex chemical equations for all the possible combinations of chemicals the lab is experimenting with. Wensaslaus, majors in Computer Science and hasn't touched chemistry since his high school. </p>\n"
